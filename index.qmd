## üèÜ Projects

- **Trading Algorithms on Stocks (via IBKR API) and on Cryptos (via Binance API)** The aim here is to build statistical arbitrage strategies on different markets, implement them in Python, and apply them to Interactives Brokers.

- **Deep and Reinforcement Learning for Black-Scholes Options Pricing and Hedging** Here, we have used the new Deep and Reinforcement learning tools to calculate the value of vanilla options and the associated hedging strategies.

- **Correlation between economic conditions and stock market profits (Python)** Using simple statistical analyses (linear regression), we have tried to verify that stock markets (S&P500) are correlated with economic indicators (inflation, unemployment rate, interest rate).

- **Statistical inference analysis and the ML models on DAX and EURO STOXX Futures** The aim here was to build trading strategies using machine learning to build trading strategies.
